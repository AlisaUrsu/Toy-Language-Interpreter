# Toy Language Interpreter
This repository contains a Toy Language Interpreter which is a simplified interpreter designed to execute programs written in Java. It incorporates advanced features such as type checking, multithreading, and a debugger with a graphical user interface. Additionally, it supports garbage collection and allows users to observe the execution of multiple threads concurrently.

## Advanced Features
### 1. Type Checker
- Ensures variables and expressions follow type rules.
### 2. Multithreading
- Supports multiple threads for concurrent program operations.
### 3. Debugger with GUI
- Visualizes program execution for step-by-step debugging.

- **Execution Stack**: Displays the current state of the call stack, showing active function calls.
- **Symbols Table**: Shows the current variables and their values in each scope.
- **Heap**: Visualizes dynamically allocated memory and its usage.
- **File Table**: Lists open files and their statuses.
- **Out List**: Shows the output generated by the program.
- **Program IDs**: Displays IDs of running threads.
